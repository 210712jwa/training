This repository will contain demos and environment setup information for the program. It will be split into 2 different sections:
- 2 Week Feeder (from 7/12 - 7/23)
- 10 Week Java with Automation (7/26 - 10/1)

# Required Technologies (Feeder)
**REQUIRED:** When first starting with the training program, you will need to have the required technologies below. These technologies are required to complete the first phase of the program, which is the 2 week feeder program.

- **Git**: Git is the most widely utilized version control tool in the world of programming. You will use Git to track changes in your own projects as well as to collaborate with fellow associates and the trainer
- **Java SE Development Kit 8**: Java 8 will be the primary language during the program. The JDK (Java Development Kit) contains the compiler and runtime environment needed to develop and run Java applications
- **Spring Tool Suite 4**: Spring Tool Suite 4 is an _integrated development environment (IDE)_. We do not actually need an IDE to write code, but IDEs provide features that make rapid development (e.g. code autosuggestions and refactoring code) easier.
- **Visual Studio Code**: We will be utilizing Visual Studio Code as our text editor. It contains more powerful features than simple text editors like Notepad and is especially useful when developing frontend applications.

## Installation
Please refer to the following section of the repository for guides on how to install each of these technologies.
