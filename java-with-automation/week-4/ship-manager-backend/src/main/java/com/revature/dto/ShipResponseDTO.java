	// Here I might describe various properties that should be sent to the user as a response
	// The reason for having this DTO, is to prevent ALL information from being received (from a security standpoint)
	// Because if the ship was approved by an admin, you would also see the information about the admin,
	// such as his username and password, on the frontend
